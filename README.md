# JAX PDX Nextflow DSL2 Pipelines

This repository contains production bioinformatic analysis pipelines for The Jackson Laboratory Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) projects. These workflows include contributions from Anuj Srivastava, Xing Yi Woo, Mike Lloyd, Carolyn Paisie, Sai Lek, and Brian Sanderson.

**Note**: these workflows use containers and reference files that are privately stored on the JAX HPCC Elion. We are currently working to publish the containers in a public repository to enable portability of these workflows. For the time being we have published this code here to provide details about the analyses that generated the results published on [our web portal](http://tumor.informatics.jax.org).

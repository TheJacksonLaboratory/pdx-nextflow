        Terminates the run if less than 50% HQ reads.

        Files passed to this tool, ins and outs:
        Ins: 
          1: end1.fastq
          2: filter directory
        Outs:
          1: end1.fq_trimmed

        Note that out_1 is not referenced in this file.
        This file is produced implicitly.  But by referencing it
        in the outs list, we get it appropriately marked for
        our file-based dependency job scheduling.

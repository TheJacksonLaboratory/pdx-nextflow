This pipeline is generally archived, but was updated in November 2015
to bring it in line with the other pipelines being used in the PDX
project, in terms of the data reported.  Specifically, it is updated
to
 - report microIndels (already being called, but not included in the
   output), and
 - compute and report alternate allele frequencies, to enable the
   database to easily filter
   - low AF variants (AF < 5%), and
   - germline variants (40% < AF < 60% OR 90% < AF)

We are no longer running the TruSeq panel, so after all samples are
rerun, this pipeline will be re-archived.

Changes:
(Move this to the git commit)

- Change from old filtering IlluQC_PRLL.pl to filter_trim.py, like
  all of out current pipelines.
- Move xenome processing after filtering.
- Change snpEff to V4.0e.
- Update GATK to 3.4-0
- Update dbsnp to 9606_b144_hg19/All_20150605_chr.vcf
- add -canon option to snpEff, for canonical transcript reporting.
- Report microIndels (previously called, but not reported
- Calculate AF on all variants
- Change main output file (for DB upload) to *Annotated.tab, the same
  as the Xenome CTP pipeline.

====

Earlier comments:

This is the TruSeq snpEff_exome pipeline created by Anuj to process
PDX sample data that had been generated using the Illumina TruSeq
cancer panel.

This pipeline is archived for safekeeping, but is no longer in use,
as we are no longer using the TruSeq panel.

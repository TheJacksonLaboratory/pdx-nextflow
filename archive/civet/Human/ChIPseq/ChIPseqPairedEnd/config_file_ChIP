aligned_qc.WGSmetricsMapQuality=30 ###Phred scale mapping quality; only alignment above will be used in coverage estimation
aligned_qc.mapQuality=30 ###Phred scale mapping quality; alignment below this mapquality will be filtered out prior to peak calling
callpeaks.broadpeak=  ##### Put --broad if want braod peaks to be called, default is off
callpeaks.qvalue=0.01 
callpeaks.outdir=macs_out
callpeaks.summit=  ####Put --call-summits to call summit from peak; default off
####Uncomment bellow to let MACS bypass building the shifting model.
#callpeaks.nomodel=--nomodel
####unsure if this one will work, here as a test
#callpeaks.extsize=--extsize 200
callpeaks.shift=0 ###recommended to be zero for BAM paired end data
peakanno.maxgap=100 ###+/- peak summit width (bp)

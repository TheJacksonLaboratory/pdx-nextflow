    <option name="trimLength"    display_name="Trim Length"        command_text="--length" type="numeric"   value="30" 
      description="Discard reads that became shorter than this length because of either quality or adapter trimming. A value of 0 effectively disables this behavior. For paired-end files, both reads of a read-pair need to be longer than bp to be printed out to validated paired-end files" />

      description="Trim low-quality ends from reads in addition to adapter removal. For RRBS samples, quality trimming will be performed first, and adapter trimming is carried in a second round. Other files are quality and adapter trimmed in a single pass. The algorithm is the same as the one used by BWA"/>
    <option name="adapOverlap"   display_name="Adaptor Overlap"    command_text="--stringency"   type="numeric"   value="1"
      description="Overlap with adapter sequence required to trim a sequence. Defaults to a very stringent setting of 1, i.e. even a single base pair of overlapping sequence will be trimmed of the 3' end of any read." />

      description="Specifies that the input file was an MspI digested RRBS sample (recognition site: CCGG). Sequences which were adapter-trimmed will have a further 2 bp removed from their 3' end. This is to avoid that the filled-in C close to the second MspI site in a sequence is used for methylation calls. Sequences which were merely trimmed because of poor quality will not be shortened further." />
    <option name="non_directional" display_name="Non-Directional"   command_text="--non_directional" type="boolean" value="true"
      description="Selecting this option for non-directional RRBS libraries will screen quality-trimmed sequences for CAA or CGA at the start of the read and, if found, removes the first two base pairs. Like with the option --rrbs this avoids using cytosine positions that were filled-in during the end-repair step. --non_directional requires --rrbs to be specified as well" />

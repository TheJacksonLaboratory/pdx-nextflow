# the following Baylor samples' fastq files were tagged as Whole_Exome_BAYLOR.
# On cadillac these used a special civet pipeline that used Baylor-specific reference files,
# (./pipelines/Cadillac/civet_4.7.1.1/Exome/WholeExome/Baylor_config_file_Whole_Exome_Single_Sample)
# Therefore these should be EXCLUDED from the plain-vanilla whole exome pipeline.
